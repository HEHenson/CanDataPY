# CanDataPY
A system for converting downloaded Cansim Matrices into Python Panda's data
This is an Alpha Version of a system under development.  It is intended to be a Python framework for the automation of the download process of Statistics Canada data.  At this point in time, it has only been tested with a single matrix.  Currently, the following features are under development:
- Development of a logging system to perform diagnostics on each download
- Install the archival system that is mentioned in the documentation
- Adding more Unit Tests to validate reliability of system
  - Initial results look promissing
- More options will be added to CSV import.  Currently only downloads by rows for monthly, quarterly and annual data are supported.  
  - Both weekly and government fiscal year will appear soon.
  - Time on vertical axis has just been added
